USE sakila;

-- 1. Select all movie titles without duplicates.

-- First, explore the table of interest and check how many films are there to identify duplicates.
SELECT *
FROM film; -- Output shows 1000 rows

SELECT COUNT(film_id) AS total_movies
FROM film; -- Double-check

-- This query shows all movie titles without duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT title AS movie_title
FROM film;

-- 2. Display the titles of all movies with a "PG-13" rating.
SELECT title AS pg13_title
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'PG-13'; -- 223 movies

-- 3. Find the title and description of all movies that contain the word "amazing" in the description.
SELECT title, description AS amazing_description 
FROM film
WHERE description LIKE '%amazing%'; -- 48 results

-- 4. Find the title of all movies longer than 120 minutes.
SELECT title AS over2h_title
FROM film
WHERE length >120; -- 457 movies

-- 5. Retrieve the names of all actors.

-- 3 OPTIONS TO SOLVE

-- 1. SELECT all first names without removing duplicates
SELECT first_name 
FROM actor; -- 200 rows

-- 2. REMOVE duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT first_name 
FROM actor; -- 128 unique names

-- 3. SELECT full names of all actors
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM actor; -- 200 rows

-- 6. Find the first and last name of actors whose last name includes "Gibson".
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE '%GIBSON%'; -- 1 actor

-- 7. Find the names of actors with an actor_id between 10 and 20.

-- Include actor_id to confirm we are selecting the correct range (limits included)
SELECT actor_id, first_name 
FROM actor
WHERE actor_id BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

-- 8. Find the titles of the movies that are not rated "R" or "PG-13".

-- 2 EXAMPLES: using != and AND or using NOT IN

-- 1.
SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating != 'PG-13' AND rating != 'R'; -- 582 movies

-- 2.
SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating NOT IN ('PG-13','R'); -- 582 movies

-- 9. Count the total number of movies by rating and show the rating with the count.

-- 2 interpretations

-- Using the rating column as classification
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_movies, rating AS classification
FROM film
GROUP BY rating; -- 5 classifications

-- Using the category from the category table
-- Order by total and then alphabetically in case of ties
SELECT c.name AS category, COUNT(f.film_id) AS total_movies
FROM film AS f
LEFT JOIN film_category AS fc USING(film_id)
LEFT JOIN category AS c USING(category_id)

FROM customer AS c
LEFT JOIN rental AS r USING(customer_id)
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY total_rented DESC; -- 599 customers

-- 11. Count the total number of movies rented by category and show the category name with the count.

-- 12. Find the average movie duration by rating and show the rating and average duration.

-- Using the rating column as classification
SELECT rating AS classification, ROUND(AVG(length),2) AS avg_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating; -- 5 ratings

-- Using the category from the category table

FROM category AS c
INNER JOIN film_category AS fc USING(category_id)
INNER JOIN film AS f USING (film_id)
INNER JOIN inventory AS i USING(film_id)
INNER JOIN rental AS r USING(inventory_id)
